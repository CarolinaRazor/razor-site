As the marching band played on the steps of Wilson Library to a crowd excited for the football game, I approached a family to offer information about North Carolina candidates. 

“We already know who we’re voting for,” the dad said, subtly saying what others said straight out: *Not your candidate.* Still, he took my flyer—perhaps out of curiosity, or just Southern politeness.

It was my second day canvassing for the Democratic Party. I was one of 10 UNC students hired to give out candidate information, sign people up for early voting reminders, and register them to vote.

We had a big goal: to get more college students to vote. Only 60% of the 569,000 college students in the state voted in 2020. 

I wanted badly to flip North Carolina blue, win Kamala the election, and save democracy. 

But I’d soon realize that the biggest challenge was not Trump supporters, indifferent students, or my own shyness — it was the lack of organization in our campus organizing program.

<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Democrats’ NC campus program has grown at a breakneck pace from a handful of organizers in August to more than 36 across the state today.

Theo Nollert, head of campus organizing at the NC Coordinated Campaign,  wanted him to hire 10 more UNC students, but Elijah Imlay, the full-time organizer at UNC, said “no, I need to manage the people I already have.”

My first week, I got an email from Eli asking me to track my hours approaching people with a QR code and getting them to fill out a commit-to-vote form. As a naturally reserved person with no training, I was nervous. 

So I didn’t do any canvassing until that Friday, when I met three other organizers: Hadi, Sasha, and Jerome. We showed up at the Pit with clipboards in hand — but our boss Eli wasn’t there.

So we taught ourselves how to canvas, finding our own style and script, asking “Are you registered to vote?” or “Are you voting this year? Would you like some reminders about your closest early voting site?”

Hadi had volunteered for campaigns in high school, and Jerome oozed casual charm and shared tips from doing door-to-door sales. 

But really, it was trial by fire. We were making it up as we went along — just like the entire campus organizing program.

From the beginning of the year, I knew I wanted to volunteer. I met Eli when he was canvassing solo, standing with a QR code on the diagonal path on the Quad.

I went to Young Democrat events — it was pure excitement. Candidates for state offices spoke to packed rooms. One hundred of us drove two hours to see Kamala Harris at her 17,000-person rally in Greensboro. 

The volunteers were usually more interesting than the politicians. Each one had a different story about why they volunteer and what they believe: a nursing student phone-banked because her number-one issue was abortion, and a former NSA officer who served in Iraq knocked on doors and trained volunteers in Guilford County because he believes democracy is at risk.

Volunteers have the quiet courage needed to approach a stranger and have an honest, possibly difficult conversation. And their stories can be one of the most effective ways to change a vote.

Since the 2020 election, progressive organizations have experimented with “deep canvassing,” where the volunteer and other person share emotional, personal stories for up to 15 minutes. 

David Broockman, a political scientist who used randomized controlled trials to study its impact, said “it’s basically the largest effect I’ve ever seen for any political tactic,” leading to about one in 10 voters changing their vote. 

Traditional canvassing, limited to a shorter, pre-designed script, is still more effective than other strategies like phone calls, mailers, or advertising.

Young people are less engaged in politics, and volunteer less. While up to 17.8% or people aged 18-24 volunteered in 2021, according to Census Bureau data, only 7% of people aged 18-29 have [volunteered for political campaigns](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/youth-are-interested-political-action-lack-support-and-opportunities).

But thanks to a new generation of politicians and activists, there are signs that youth engagement is increasing: the 18 to 25-year-old voting rate broke its highest ever in 2020.

Even in the rain, I felt lucky to canvas with Anderson Clayton, the youngest state party chair in the country, and a symbol of this new generation. She shared the same message that she championed on MSNBC and the floor of the Democratic Convention — more young people in politics — with passing UNC students:

“By just filling out your ballot for Democrats,” she said, “you can reduce the average age of politicians on the Council of State by 20 years.”

She was completely at home handing out “Experience over Extremism” fliers, because she had started out as a campus volunteer too, at App State. 

And she gave me the nickname “rain man” for choosing the downpour with my umbrella over the relative safety of the Student Union entryway.

Eli and Esme, the two full-time organizers at UNC, have shared concerns about the organization of the campus program.

They described a training retreat in Greensboro that was “completely useless,” Eli said. “They put us up in a hotel, Theo spoke for about an hour, and then he sent us away and said ‘Go collect CTVs’ and we didn’t have any more training for the rest of the two days,” he said. Instead, they are left to reach out individually to fellow organizers to improve their own approach.

Nollert acknowledged the training was disappointing but said “it wasn’t my fault,” explaining that “I have nothing to benchmark against” in terms of campus organizing programs.

The organizing programs were started by the county parties, Eli said, but as Election Day nears, the state and national parties have given campus organizers  ever-increasing CTV goals and required “capacity-building” events, and have begun to direct organizers how to do their jobs.

And every day at 2 p.m., even if canvassing is going strong, Eli and Esme have to hop on a Zoom call to phone-bank while their boss supervises them.

“It’s something beyond burnout at this point,” Eli said. Esme said she felt “frazzled” and has dealt with health issues since taking the job.

It's also easy to wonder why the party invested $150,000 in the UNC program instead of other campuses when 90% of UNC students were registered and 82% voted in 2020, which is likely the highest rate in North Carolina.
