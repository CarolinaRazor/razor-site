Cinnamon Weaver, the department manager for UNC Statistics, was in a virtual meeting on Aug. 28 when an alert buzzed her phone at 1:03 p.m. 

“Emergency: Police report an Armed and Dangerous Person On or Near Campus” it read. She stepped into the third-floor hallway of Hanes Hall. “Oh my god,” someone said.

Alarms blared outside and frightened students ran into the closest building they could find. Soon after the 3-hour lockdown on Aug. 28, the UNC community would learn that one person, Professor Zijie Yan, had been shot in Caudill Labs.

Weaver rushed downstairs, directed students into classrooms and told them to close the blinds and lock the doors, she said in an interview. Weaver and her colleague Danielle Ross walked door to door, floor by floor, checking to make sure students, faculty, and staff were safely hunkered away.

“I've been here 20 some years and I realized I don't know what I'm supposed to do at this moment,” Weaver said.

Like many department managers at the University, Weaver had been designated the [building emergency coordinator](https://ehs.unc.edu/topics/emergency-coordinators-and-emergency-action-plan/). But she'd received no training and knew of no plans for a lockdown. She didn’t know what her role was.

“Am I supposed to go be responsible for other people? Am I supposed to just lock myself up? Am I supposed to lock my staff up?” she said. 

Five emergency coordinators, who are supposed to sweep their different buildings to alert and help occupants, said in interviews they each picked a different option: from staying put to locking down their whole building. 

The coordinators said they had little or no plans or training, and no way to communicate with UNC’s Office of Emergency Management during a crisis.

Four of the six coordinators interviewed said they want required training and more frequent communication.

## No lockdown plan

Building emergency coordinators are responsible for creating an emergency plan and sweeping through their assigned area to alert occupants and help any that need assistance, according to a UNC [policy](https://policies.unc.edu/TDClient/2833/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=131954). They are required to complete an “Emergency Action Plan Worksheet” that lists evacuation points, areas of refuge and hazardous materials, and department contacts.

Only one of the six coordinators interviewed said they filled out the worksheet. No coordinator had heard of or completed the “[Annual Emergency Coordinator Training](https://ehs.unc.edu/training/self-study/emergency-coordinator-annual-update/)” also listed in the UNC policy.

Diana Devereaux, department manager for City and Regional Planning, said she had minimal communication with Emergency Management. “I get the occasional email from them once a year, maybe twice a year,” she said.

“There aren't actual emergency plans,” Weaver said. When asked about the fire evacuation route described by her colleague Ross, she said “I mean, okay, yes, if that’s a plan, yes.”

Valerie Bernhardt, coordinator for the Department of Germanic & Slavic Languages, said that they only had fire plans. “There's no lockdown plan,” she said, and the frequency of her contact with Emergency Management was “never.”

Jason Worrell, the emergency coordinator for Caudill Labs, was in another building at the time. He didn’t go out to help because it was against policy, he said, and he does no training or planning besides fire drills.

“We are essentially just a point of contact” between building occupants and the fire and police departments, he said.

## Instead of optional, infrequent training, it should be required, coordinators say

After the lockdown, many coordinators requested active shooter training from UNC Police, including Bernhardt, Deveraux and those from two professional schools. But attendance is typically not mandatory for staff.

At the School of Public Health, which [has over 500 employees](https://sph.unc.edu/resource-pages/quick-facts/), only 100 people attended a virtual training and about 30 participated in an in-person one, said their facilities director Brent Wishart.

Besides active shooter situations, UNC has an [Emergency Action Plan](https://campussafety.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/873/2021/09/emergency-action-plan.pdf) with instructions for 11 other kinds of emergencies, including explosions, earthquakes, hurricanes, bombs, and hazardous materials, but coordinators received no training for any of them.

Four coordinators said emergency training should be required for all UNC employees, and Weaver said they should train students too.

Deveraux said they should “just schedule us” for annual in-person training. She suggested they could hire an external team to run trainings that cover everything from student mental health crises and active shooter situations to broken building equipment.

Bernhardt said training should be included in the online employee orientation. “Why can't they require people to do a half-hour safety training for lockdowns?” she said.

## Roles and responsibilities

The purpose of UNC’s emergency management policies is “to clearly define and assign roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for managing emergency situations,” according to a 2020 internal audit.

Yet the receptionists in many departments were unclear about who exactly their emergency coordinator is, giving multiple possible names despite consulting a directory or supervisor. 

Sometimes, the coordinators themselves were unsure too. Shannon Eubanks, the Political Science department manager who several people identified as the emergency coordinator, said “I guess that’s me.”

Building emergency coordinators have taken vastly different approaches to the vague responsibilities of the role. In the College of Arts and Sciences, most departments assign the emergency coordinator role to their department manager, Deveraux said. “It’s not our title, it’s a task” — one of many others, like managing the budget, faculty, and building repairs — so “it's not top of mind for me,” she said.

In other schools and high-traffic libraries and student buildings, the emergency coordinator is often a facilities manager or administrator, like Wishart. He said the Gillings School of Public Health is better prepared than others because of financial support, good relationships with UNC Police, and his focus on emergency preparedness. Wishart does annual planning and training, and Gillings was the first school to ensure all rooms had locks in 2016.

When your correspondent visited the offices of dozens of different department managers, four were working from home, leaving their buildings vulnerable to emergencies in the absence of a backup coordinator.

## No contact

Coordinators had no way to communicate with UNC Police or Emergency Management other than calling 9-11, except for Wishart who spoke with two on-site police officers.

Bernhardt said she would have liked to know that Dey Hall was “50 feet from where the shooting happened.” The University should share key details with emergency coordinators and department chairs, she said, though she understands the need to limit access to information that could provoke threats. 

Instead, coordinators got information anywhere they could — the news, emails, AlertCarolina, and Twitter — and shared it in-person or sent it to email groups. 

Ross was texting her husband, a police officer, for advice. Weaver said that made her “feel more comfortable” about going floor to floor and helping people lock down.

## Expectations vs. Reality

At a [news conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sypWalYdXI) the night of Aug. 28, Police Chief Brian James said: “It was important that every member of the organization of UNC assigned to those various buildings understands how to lock down a classroom or any type of structure that they are in,” referring to the emergency coordinators.

Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz said UNC’s plans existed “to ensure that every faculty member as well as student or staff understood what to do” in an emergency.

But Bernhardt said she felt the University should not “tell the press that the whole university is trained,” or “that this university is prepared when it's not.”

The administration has been aware of a lack of training and planning for active shooter events since a 2020 Office of Internal Audit [report](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article280081904.html). The audit highlighted that training was optional and infrequent and many buildings had no specific plans.

Auditors recommended that all employees be required to participate in UNC Police’s training, and that departments create emergency plans for every building that include barricaded lockdown areas and medical supplies to stop traumatic hemorrhaging. 

Instead of requiring training, UNC management decided to review “training resources and notification systems.” Leadership said they would develop a “concept/template” of how to create emergency plans for every building by December 2020. But multiple building emergency coordinators said they have no specific building plans as of 2023.

## Winds of Change

A [press release](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/12/04/university-releases-summary-of-aug-28-incident-feedback-portal/) four months after the Aug. 28 shooting said “a third-party vendor” would conduct “a formal after-action review” of the University’s response and emergency plans. 

The review “is needed in order to make decisions about any necessary changes,” said UNC spokesperson Erin Spandorf in an emailed statement. She did not comment on details about emergency coordinators’ lack of training, planning, or communication capabilities.

At a Sept. 8 Faculty Governance meeting, Chancellor Guskiewicz said "We will assess whether more required trainings should be considered.”

But with Guskiewicz [leaving](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article282809328.html) UNC on January 12 for another campus reeling from a shooting and the UNC System facing [controversy](https://www.chronicle.com/article/with-their-chancellor-likely-leaving-chapel-hill-insiders-fear-a-new-leader-has-already-been-chosen) over his successor, it’s unclear who will decide which recommendations to implement.

Many groups within UNC are reviewing emergency preparedness issues. The University, College, and several Schools each [sent feedback forms](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2023/09/14/university-opens-feedback-portal-for-aug-28-emergency-response/) to employees and students.

Department chairs and managers spoke for almost two hours about the shooting in a meeting with College leadership. “They did seem to listen and they said they were reviewing” the events and policies, Weaver said.

Employees’ comments mirrored [suggestions](https://campussafety.unc.edu/news/2023/12/01/executive-summary-for-aug-28-incident-feedback-portal/) from students and the public, Bernhardt and Wishart said, including  improving AlertCarolina, mandating training, and getting better infrastructure like locks and cameras. 

Some coordinators are optimistic that their feedback will prompt UNC leadership to make changes.

“Did they mess up? I think they did,” Bernhardt said, “But their heart is in the right place.”

For now, building emergency coordinators will do the best with what they have.

Bernhardt goes to work every day on a floor whose windows look out at Caudill Labs, where the pane of glass pierced by a bullet has been replaced.

Even though being a building emergency coordinator “is not written in any job description,” she said, “I still feel it’s my responsibility to make sure people are safe.”

“I'm not the only one,” she said.
